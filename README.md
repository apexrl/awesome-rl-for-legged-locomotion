## Survey and Reviews

+ [Learning-based Legged Locomotion State of the Art and Future Perspectives](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02783649241312698). *IJRR*, 2025.

    A broad survey of recent advances in learning-based approaches for legged robots. Discusses core challenges like sim-to-real transfer, perception integration, and domain adaptation. It also provides insight into ongoing trends and future research avenues.

## Core Papers by ETH Robotics System Lab

+ [Learning Agile and Dynamic Motor Skills for Legged Robots](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scirobotics.aau5872). *Science Robotics*, 2019.

    A foundational work demonstrating RL-based locomotion on the ANYmal quadruped using a motor model learned from real data.
    The motor model is used to compensate the sim-to-real gap during RL training in simulation.
    Achieves robust locomotion (including running at target speeds and recovering from falls) transferred successfully from simulation to real hardware.

+ [Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion over Challenging Terrain](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scirobotics.abc5986). *Science Robotics*, 2020.

    Another foundational work. Introduces a two-stage "teacher-student" framework. The teacher leverages privileged information in simulation to learn a robust gait; a student policy then distills it into a deployable form using only on-board accessible observations. The paper also pioneered terrain curricula for robust traversal of challenging terrains.
    Note that, at the time, ETH's control strategy are relatively complex: the model only assist in generating foot-end trajectories, while the target joints are obtained by inverse kinematics. More recent works usually learn the model to output target joint positions directly.

+ [DTC: Deep Tracking Control](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scirobotics.adh5401). *Science Robotics*, 2024.

    Integrates model-based trajectory optimization at the high level with a learned RL policy at the low level. The upper layer plans precise footholds and body trajectories, while the policy tracks these trajectories tightly. Excels at tasks requiring precise footstep placement, e.g., crossing "stepping stones" or narrow beams.

## Core Papers by KAIST

+ [Concurrent Training of a Control Policy and a State Estimator for Dynamic and Robust Legged Locomotion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9714001/). *RA-L*, 2022.

    Proposes a one-stage asymmetric RL framework in which the policy and an onboard state estimator (for velocity, foot height, contact probabilities, etc.) are trained simultaneously.
